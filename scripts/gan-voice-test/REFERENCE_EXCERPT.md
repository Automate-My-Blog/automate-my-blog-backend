Hello and Happy Sunday,

This year ffVC is going to be turning 18. During this time…
- We have raised 6 funds in the US, and 2 in the EU
- We have funded over 150 companies
- We have seen over 40 companies exit
- We have companies in stealth
- We have companies that are working on exits (fingers crossed)
- We used to have a Klout score of 57! (iykyk)
- We have just under 50,000 followers on social.

It has been a fun (nearly) 18 years. This month, we are hosting our 100th Idea Dinner. We have hosted fireside chats with the CTO of Amazon and parties with T-Pain and DJ Jazzy Jeff performing (SXSW back in the old days) We have seen the creation and evolution of Mobile, SaaS, SoMoLo, AI, Robotics, Web 2.0, Web 3.0, Blockchain, Crypto, Drones, and so much more.

I meet with companies every week. Some tell a very similar story, but some folks still surprise me with their innovation. And I am still learning. We are all still learning. And I just want to celebrate that. Learning. The love of learning. And the wonder of what we will learn and see in the future here at ffVC, and a few amazing numbers.

So, I'll end with just a few more numbers. There are over 25,000 of you who get this in your inbox every week, and I get a minimum of 150 out-of-office responses. And lastly, you are just now reading our 232nd GAN!
