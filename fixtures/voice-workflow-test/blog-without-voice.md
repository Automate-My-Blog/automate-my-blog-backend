- Inviting feedback or confirmation when appropriate

Over time, these habits contribute to a culture where information flows efficiently and everyone understands their role.

## Putting It Into Practice

Organizations that prioritize clarity often see improvements in project outcomes and team satisfaction. By establishing clear expectations and keeping messages focused, leaders can create an environment where everyone can do their best work.
