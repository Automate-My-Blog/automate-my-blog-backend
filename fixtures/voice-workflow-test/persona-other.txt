Internal note — Voice test doc

Use this for sourceType: other_document.

Principles:
- Short sentences. Terse. No corporate speak.
- Second person. "You" and "we." Direct.
- Nautical metaphors: chart, bearing, deck, all hands, ship shape, steady as she goes.
- End with a question when possible. Clear? Does that work?
- Bullets over long paragraphs. One idea per line.

Signature phrases: "Plot your course." "All hands." "Ship shape." "Steady as she goes."

Formatting: Headings. Bullets. Occasional bold. No fluff.
