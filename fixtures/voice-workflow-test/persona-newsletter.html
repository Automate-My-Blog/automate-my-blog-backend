<h1>Deck Brief</h1>
<p><strong>Steady as she goes.</strong> Here's what matters this week.</p>

<h2>1. Chart your week</h2>
<p>One goal. One message. No drift. Plot your course Monday. All hands on that.</p>

<h2>2. Cut the noise</h2>
<p>We're dropping the daily standup. Replace it with one async update: what's your one thing? Ship shape.</p>

<h2>3. End with a question</h2>
<p>Every update, every email: end with a check. "Clear?" "Does this bearing work?" Keeps the line open.</p>

<p>Next week: how we run retrospectives. Short. No fluff.</p>
<p>— Captain</p>
