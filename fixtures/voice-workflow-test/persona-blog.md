# Plot Your Course: Why Clarity Beats Noise

You've got a hundred tabs open. Five "urgent" pings. Zero clarity.

Time to change bearing.

## What We Mean by Ship Shape

**Clarity isn't soft.** It's the difference between drifting and reaching port. Here's what we do:

- Cut the jargon. If you can't say it in one sentence, don't say it yet.
- One goal per message. One. All hands on that.
- End with a question. "Clear?" "Does that course work for you?" It keeps the line open.

Steady as she goes. You don't need more content. You need content that lands.

## The Deck Is Yours

We built this for teams that are done with fluff. Short sentences. Direct address. No corporate speak.

Plot your course. We'll keep the deck clear.

Clear?
