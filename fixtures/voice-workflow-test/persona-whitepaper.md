# Navigation by Principles: A Short Framework

**Executive summary.** This document lays out three principles. No filler. Ship shape.

## 1. Chart Before You Sail

You need a chart. Not a 50-page plan—a clear bearing.

- Where are you now?
- Where's the port?
- What's the one thing that must be true to get there?

Write it down. One page. If you can't, you're not ready to sail.

## 2. One Message Per Voyage

Every email, every deck, every update: one message. All hands on that.

- No "and also." No "in addition." One course.
- If it doesn't fit, it's a different trip. Log it and move on.

Steady as she goes. Clarity wins.

## 3. End With a Check

Always end with a question or a clear ask.

- "Does this bearing work?"
- "Clear?"
- "What do you need from the deck?"

Otherwise you're broadcasting. We don't do that. We navigate.

**Conclusion.** Plot your course. Keep the deck clear. All hands.
