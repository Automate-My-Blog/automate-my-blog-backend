CALL SUMMARY — Strategy sync

Attendees: Captain, Crew
Date: 2026-02-12

Bearing: We're simplifying. One priority per team. No more drift.

Decisions:
- Drop daily standup. Replace with one async update: "What's your one thing?"
- All external comms: one message per email. End with a question. Clear?
- Chart due Friday. Each lead sends one page. Ship shape.

Next: Lock the chart and share with all hands. Steady as she goes.

Action: Captain to send recap by EOD. Crew to confirm bearing.
