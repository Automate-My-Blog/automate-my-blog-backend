All hands,

Quick update on Q4. We're changing bearing.

- Old course: too many priorities. We were drifting.
- New course: one goal per team. One. Ship shape.
- Deadline: end of week. I need your one thing by Friday.

Does that work? Reply with your one priority and we'll lock the chart.

Clear?

Captain
